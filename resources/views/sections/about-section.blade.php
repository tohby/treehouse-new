                        I like to define myself as a simple man who has found what makes him happy. At the end of the day, a small seed with a little water grows into a giant tree. Greatness starts with simplicity. People ask me how I feel when my art is appreciated or trashed, honestly, I 100% don’t care. People will come and go; they will see what they want to see, when and if they are ready to see it. What’s important is for me to be authentic. Be who you are. <a href="#">read more</a>
